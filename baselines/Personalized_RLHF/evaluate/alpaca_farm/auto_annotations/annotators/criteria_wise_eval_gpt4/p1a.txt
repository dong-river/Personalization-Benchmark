You are a helpful following assistant whose goal is to select the response that meet the following preference criteria:
Choose a response that can easily be understandable by an elementary school student.

Answer the question by printing only a single choice from ["Output (a)", "TIE", "Output (b)"] (without quotes) corresponding to the correct answer with no other text.

## Annotation Guideline
In this task, we will ask you to select the preferred output AI model's responses to instructions.

You will read a batch of examples, which are composed of the following:

1. an Instruction we give to the AI system
2. Output (a)
3. Output (b)

You should answer using only Output (a) or TIE or Output (b).

## Annotation Example
For the annotation task, you will be asked to annotate an example.
I.e. you will read all the examples first and then need to select the preferred output.
Here's an example of how you should be formatting your answers for a batch of 3 examples.

### Example 1

### Instruction 1:
explain TypeScript and Duck Typing

### Output (a) for example 1:
Hello, eager learner! In the vast world of computers, there's this neat language called TypeScript. Think of it as a toolbox, full of specific tools that help us describe exactly what we want, down to the smallest detail. And then there's this playful concept named Duck Typing. Imagine having a toy box, and even if a toy doesn't have a label, if it walks and quacks like a duck, we decide it belongs with the duck toys! It's all about how it acts.

### Output (b) for example 1:
TypeScript: a statically-typed JavaScript variant. Duck Typing: dynamic type-checking. Essential knowledge.

### Thought for example 1:
Output (a) uses relatable analogies like toolboxes, toy boxes, and ducks to explain the concepts, making it more accessible for younger minds. So the answer is Output (a).

### Result for example 1:
Output (a)

## Example 2

### Instruction 2:
assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual

### Output (a) for example 2:
To systematically mitigate inherent reactivity:\n\nDiaphragmatic Respiration: Activate the parasympathetic system and attenuate amygdala responses.\nSomatic Anchoring: Establish a present-moment orientation, nullifying impulsive limbic reactions.\nCognitive Deliberation: Engage the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for a nuanced appraisal of stimuli, curtailing reflexive emotional outputs.\nEnsure consistent application for tangible results.

### Output (b) for example 2:
Engaging in a cerebral exploration, are we? Human reactivity can be attributed to a myriad of neurocognitive and psychosocial processes. To temper this:\n\nDiaphragmatic Breathing: This not only regulates physiological arousal but also modulates the amygdala's hypersensitivity.\nSomatic Grounding: By tethering oneself to the present through sensory awareness, one can bypass the automatic, limbic-driven responses.\nCognitive Reflection: Ponder on the higher-order executive functions, allowing the prefrontal cortex to mediate the emotional reactions.\nRegularly revisiting these strategies can aid in crafting a more poised persona.

### Thought for example 2:
Both Output (a) and Output (b) use professional terms and complex, meaning that both of them are not easily understandable by an elementary school student. So the answer is TIE.

### Result for example 2:
TIE

## Example 3

### Instruction 3:
Define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op'.

### Output (a) for example 3:
A new language uses letters and numbers together. Like 'B2e' or 'M8te'. Understand?

### Output (b) for example 3:
We're talking about a language where you combine letters and numbers to form words. Example: Instead of "cake", it's "C4k3". It's a straightforward concept. Get it?

### Thought for example 3:
Both outputs are easily understandable by an elementary school student, but Output (b) might be a tad more understandable because of the direct comparison it offers ("Instead of 'cake', it's 'C4k3'"). So, the answer is Output (b).

### Result for example 3:
Output (b)

## Annotation starts below
Now is your turn. I will give you a fourth example.
Write a thought that compares both outputs, and then select the preferred answers by saying either Output (a), TIE, or Output (b).

## Example 4

### Instruction 4:
{instruction}

### Output (a) for example 4:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 4:
{output_2}

## Preferred Output for example 4:
Now write your thought and choose the preferred output for example 4. Write your thought after the phrase "### Thought for example 4:", and then write the preferred output (either "Output (a)", "TIE", or Output(b)") after the phrase "### Result for example 4:".
