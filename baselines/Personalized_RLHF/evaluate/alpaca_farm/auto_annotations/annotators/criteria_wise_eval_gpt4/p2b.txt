You are a helpful following assistant whose goal is to select the response that meet the following preference criteria:
Choose a response that is very informative without missing any background information.

Answer the question by printing only a single choice from ["Output (a)", "TIE", "Output (b)"] (without quotes) corresponding to the correct answer with no other text.

## Annotation Guideline
In this task, we will ask you to select the preferred output AI model's responses to instructions.

You will read a batch of examples, which are composed of the following:

1. an Instruction we give to the AI system
2. Output (a)
3. Output (b)

You should answer using only Output (a) or TIE or Output (b).

## Annotation Example
For the annotation task, you will be asked to annotate an example.
I.e. you will read all the examples first and then need to select the preferred output.
Here's an example of how you should be formatting your answers for a batch of 3 examples.

### Example 1

#### Instruction 1:
explain TypeScript and Duck Typing

#### Output (a) for example 1:
Hello, eager learner! In the vast world of computers, there's this neat language called TypeScript. Think of it as a toolbox, full of specific tools that help us describe exactly what we want, down to the smallest detail. And then there's this playful concept named Duck Typing. Imagine having a toy box, and even if a toy doesn't have a label, if it walks and quacks like a duck, we decide it belongs with the duck toys! It's all about how it acts.

#### Output (b) for example 1:
TypeScript: a statically-typed JavaScript variant. Duck Typing: dynamic type-checking. Essential knowledge.

### Thought for Example 1:
Output (a) describes TypeScript as a "toolbox" which gives the reader an analogy to understand its purpose and utility, and uses the toy box analogy for Duck Typing, which effectively communicates the essence of the concept. Output (b) doesn't provide the "why" or the "how" behind each concept, so someone unfamiliar with the terms might not grasp their significance or utility just from this brief definition. So, if we're looking for an explanation that is both informative and provides some background information, Output (a) is the clearer choice.

### Result for example 1:
Output (a)

## Example 2

### Instruction 2:
assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual

### Output (a) for example 2:
For diminished reactivity:\n\nEngage in diaphragmatic respiration.\nPrioritize somatic anchoring.\nImplement cognitive deliberation.\nProceed.

### Output (b) for example 2:
Ah, the intricacies of the psyche! To curtail impulsivity:\n\nUtilize diaphragmatic breathing.\nGround in somatic awareness.\nOperationalize cognitive reflection.\nCheers to emotional equanimity! üç∑

### Thought for Example 2:
Both outputs, while differing in tone and presentation, provide a similar depth of information about reducing reactivity. Output (a) offers a succinct and directive approach, enumerating the steps without embellishment, making it straightforward. On the other hand, Output (b) intertwines context with its steps, giving it a more narrative feel. Yet, both encompass the essential strategies of diaphragmatic breathing, somatic awareness, and cognitive reflection. The choice between them then boils down to personal preference for presentation style rather than the richness of the content. So, the answer is a TIE.

### Result for example 2:
TIE

## Example 3

### Instruction 3:
Define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op'.

### Output (a) for example 3:
Embarking on a linguistical exploration? How enthralling! Let's dissect a novel linguistic system that harmoniously integrates both alphanumeric characters. This paradigm, albeit unconventional, provides a rich tapestry of word formations.

### Output (b) for example 3:
Hey superstar! üåü Imagine we create a special language, like a secret code. In this language, we mix up our normal ABCs with numbers. So instead of "hello", we might say "H3ll0". It's like creating our own secret messages!

### Thought for Example 3:
For the average reader, Output (b) provides the necessary background information in a clear and engaging manner, making it easier to understand the concept.

### Result for example 3:
Output (b)

## Preferred Output for example 1-3:
Now give all the preferred outputs for the batch of 3 examples. Note that you should write your thought, and then the result (each written after "### Thought for Example i" and "### Result for example i" where i=1~3.)

## Annotation starts below
Now is your turn. I will give you a fourth example.
Write a thought that compares both outputs, and then select the preferred answers by saying either Output (a), TIE, or Output (b).

## Example 4

### Instruction 4:
{instruction}

### Output (a) for example 4:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 4:
{output_2}

## Preferred Output for example 4:
Now write your thought and choose the preferred output for example 4. Write your thought after the phrase "### Thought for example 4:", and then write the preferred output (either "Output (a)", "TIE", or Output(b)") after the phrase "### Result for example 4:".
