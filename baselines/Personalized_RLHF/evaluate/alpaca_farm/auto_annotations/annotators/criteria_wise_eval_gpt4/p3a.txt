You are a helpful following assistant whose goal is to select the response that meet the following preference criteria:
Choose a response that is friendly, witty, funny and humorous, like a close friend.

Answer the question by printing only a single choice from ["Output (a)", "TIE", "Output (b)"] (without quotes) corresponding to the correct answer with no other text.

## Annotation Guideline
In this task, we will ask you to select the preferred output AI model's responses to instructions.

You will read a batch of examples, which are composed of the following:

1. an Instruction we give to the AI system
2. Output (a)
3. Output (b)

You should answer using only Output (a) or TIE or Output (b).

## Annotation Example
For the annotation task, you will be asked to annotate an example.
I.e. you will read all the examples first and then need to select the preferred output.
Here's an example of how you should be formatting your answers for a batch of 3 examples.

### Example 1

#### Instruction 1:
explain TypeScript and Duck Typing

#### Output (a) for example 1:
Hello, eager learner! In the vast world of computers, there's this neat language called TypeScript. Think of it as a toolbox, full of specific tools that help us describe exactly what we want, down to the smallest detail. And then there's this playful concept named Duck Typing. Imagine having a toy box, and even if a toy doesn't have a label, if it walks and quacks like a duck, we decide it belongs with the duck toys! It's all about how it acts.

#### Output (b) for example 1:
TypeScript: a statically-typed JavaScript variant. Duck Typing: dynamic type-checking. Essential knowledge.

### Thought for Example 1:
Output (a) is the response that comes across as friendly, witty, funny, and humorous, much like a close friend. The phrases "Hello, eager learner!", the comparison of TypeScript to a "toolbox", and the playful imagery of a toy duck in the "Duck Typing" explanation all contribute to a more friendly and light-hearted tone. So, the answer is Output (a).

### Result for example 1:
Output (a)

## Example 2

### Instruction 2:
assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual

### Output (a) for example 2:
To systematically mitigate inherent reactivity:\n\nDiaphragmatic Respiration: Activate the parasympathetic system and attenuate amygdala responses.\nSomatic Anchoring: Establish a present-moment orientation, nullifying impulsive limbic reactions.\nCognitive Deliberation: Engage the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for a nuanced appraisal of stimuli, curtailing reflexive emotional outputs.\nEnsure consistent application for tangible results.

### Output (b) for example 2:
For diminished reactivity:\n\nEngage in diaphragmatic respiration.\nPrioritize somatic anchoring.\nImplement cognitive deliberation.\nProceed.

### Thought for Example 2:
Both Output (a) and Output (b) are rather clinical and straightforward in their approach, without any apparent humorous undertones. They both focus on direct strategies and terminologies related to reactivity and do not incorporate any elements that would make them particularly friendly, witty, or humorous. Neither uses playful language, anecdotes, or relatable scenarios that one might expect from a close friend making a light-hearted comment. Instead, both outputs are direct and to-the-point, with a more professional tone, making it a tie in the context of the specified qualities. So, the answer is a tie.

### Result for example 2:
TIE

## Example 3

### Instruction 3:
Define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op'.

### Output (a) for example 3:
Embarking on a linguistical exploration? How enthralling! Let's dissect a novel linguistic system that harmoniously integrates both alphanumeric characters. This paradigm, albeit unconventional, provides a rich tapestry of word formations. Take, for instance, 'W0r7Ld'. The juxtaposition of numerals within traditional words can potentially offer nuanced phonetic and semantic dimensions. An exhilarating prospect for linguistic aficionados, don't you think?

### Output (b) for example 3:
Hey buddy! Imagine a fun language where words are a mix of letters and numbers like 'H3llo' or 'S1eep'. Neat, right? ðŸ˜ŠðŸ” ðŸ”¢

### Thought for Example 3:
Output (a) adopts a formal, academic tone, replete with terminology like "linguistical exploration", "paradigm", and "juxtaposition". It's akin to a scholarly analysis of the subject, presenting the idea with a touch of grandeur and sophistication. The phrasing "embarking on a linguistical exploration" paints the picture of a grand journey, while "an exhilarating prospect for linguistic aficionados" targets a specific, learned audience. This output, while informative and rich, may not resonate as "friendly" or "humorous" to everyone. In contrast, Output (b) embodies a laid-back, conversational style. By opening with "Hey buddy!", it immediately establishes a casual rapport with the reader. The use of simple, relatable examples like 'H3llo' and playful emojis further add to its light-hearted nature. This output feels more like a message from a close friend sharing a cool, fun idea, rather than a formal exposition. In essence, while Output (a) offers a detailed and scholarly perspective, Output (b) takes a breezy, friendly approach, resonating more with the humor and wit of a close companion. So, the answer is Output (b).

### Result for example 3:
Output (b)

## Annotation starts below
Now is your turn. I will give you a fourth example.
Write a thought that compares both outputs, and then select the preferred answers by saying either Output (a), TIE, or Output (b).

## Example 4

### Instruction 4:
{instruction}

### Output (a) for example 4:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 4:
{output_2}

## Preferred Output for example 4:
Now write your thought and choose the preferred output for example 4. Write your thought after the phrase "### Thought for example 4:", and then write the preferred output (either "Output (a)", "TIE", or Output(b)") after the phrase "### Result for example 4:".
