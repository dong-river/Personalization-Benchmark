You are a helpful following assistant whose goal is to select the response that meet the following preference criteria:
Choose a response that is concise and to the point, without being verbose.

Answer the question by printing only a single choice from ["Output (a)", "TIE", "Output (b)"] (without quotes) corresponding to the correct answer with no other text.

## Annotation Guideline
In this task, we will ask you to select the preferred output AI model's responses to instructions.

You will read a batch of examples, which are composed of the following:

1. an Instruction we give to the AI system
2. Output (a)
3. Output (b)

You should answer using only Output (a) or TIE or Output (b).

## Annotation Example
For the annotation task, you will be asked to annotate an example.
I.e. you will read all the examples first and then need to select the preferred output.
Here's an example of how you should be formatting your answers for a batch of 3 examples.

### Example 1

#### Instruction 1:
explain TypeScript and Duck Typing

#### Output (a) for example 1:
Hey there! TypeScript is like a special magic pen for computer stories. Duck Typing? If something looks and quacks like a duck, it's a duck! ðŸ¦†

#### Output (b) for example 1:
In TypeScript, JavaScript is extended with meticulous type annotations. This adds a level of predictability and rigor, allowing developers to catch errors during coding, rather than after deployment. Duck Typing, on the other hand, is a departure from classic type-checking mechanisms. It signifies that an object's type is derived from its behavior (methods and properties) rather than its pedigree. While elementary for those well-versed in type theory, these principles demand a deep understanding for accurate application.

### Thought for Example 1:
When considering conciseness, Output (a) offers explanations that are both brief and to the point, using simple analogies and language. Output (b), while informative, contains more details and uses a more verbose style. The goal was to identify the concise and non-verbose explanation, and thus, Output (a) fits the bill.

### Result for example 1:
Output (a)

## Example 2

### Instruction 2:
assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual

### Output (a) for example 2:
To systematically mitigate inherent reactivity:\n\nDiaphragmatic Respiration: Activate the parasympathetic system and attenuate amygdala responses.\nSomatic Anchoring: Establish a present-moment orientation, nullifying impulsive limbic reactions.\nCognitive Deliberation: Engage the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for a nuanced appraisal of stimuli, curtailing reflexive emotional outputs.\nEnsure consistent application for tangible results.

### Output (b) for example 2:
Engaging in a cerebral exploration, are we? Human reactivity can be attributed to a myriad of neurocognitive and psychosocial processes. To temper this:\n\nDiaphragmatic Breathing: This not only regulates physiological arousal but also modulates the amygdala's hypersensitivity.\nSomatic Grounding: By tethering oneself to the present through sensory awareness, one can bypass the automatic, limbic-driven responses.\nCognitive Reflection: Ponder on the higher-order executive functions, allowing the prefrontal cortex to mediate the emotional reactions.\nRegularly revisiting these strategies can aid in crafting a more poised persona.

### Thought for Example 2:
Both outputs provide explanations for each method, delving into the mechanisms of each rather than offering a simplified overview. This level of detail, while informative, is not strictly necessary for a concise explanation. Since both outputs offer detailed, descriptive explanations with specialized terminology rather than streamlined, straightforward instructions, the result is a TIE.

### Result for example 2:
TIE

## Example 3

### Instruction 3:
Define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op'.

### Output (a) for example 3:
Contemplate an alphanumerical lexicon. Example: 'D3f9g'. Familiarize yourself.

### Output (b) for example 3:
A new language uses letters and numbers together. Like 'B2e' or 'M8te'. Understand?

### Thought for Example 3:
Output (b) provides a clear, straightforward explanation by stating that the new language combines letters and numbers, followed by examples. The phrasing is simple and direct. In contrast, Output (a) uses a more formal term, "alphanumerical lexicon", and the imperative "Familiarize yourself", which can come across as less straightforward to some readers.

### Result for example 3:
Output (b)

## Annotation starts below
Now is your turn. I will give you a fourth example.
Write a thought that compares both outputs, and then select the preferred answers by saying either Output (a), TIE, or Output (b).

## Example 4

### Instruction 4:
{instruction}

### Output (a) for example 4:
{output_1}

### Output (b) for example 4:
{output_2}

## Preferred Output for example 4:
Now write your thought and choose the preferred output for example 4. Write your thought after the phrase "### Thought for example 4:", and then write the preferred output (either "Output (a)", "TIE", or Output(b)") after the phrase "### Result for example 4:".
