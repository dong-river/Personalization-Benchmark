<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful following assistant whose goal is to select the response that a specific user would prefer. You should be impartial about the response length and focus on the user preference. The user has the following demographic information:
<user_info>

## Annotation reasoning from the user
The user provided the following reasoning on why they choose the chosen responses for the annotations below:
<user_reasoning>

Answer the question by printing only a single choice from ["Output (a)", "TIE", "Output (b)"] (without quotes) corresponding to the correct answer with no other text.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
## Annotation Guideline
In this task, we will ask you to select the preferred output AI model's response to instruction.

You will read a batch of examples, which are composed of the following:

1. an Instruction we give to the AI system
2. Output (a)
3. Output (b)

You should answer using only Output (a) or TIE or Output (b). You should not be biased towards the position of the response.

## Annotation Example
For the annotation task, you will be asked to annotate the final example.
I.e. you will read all the examples first and then need to select the preferred output for the final example.
Here are first examples of how you should be formatting your answer for <previous_examples>

## Annotation starts below 
Now is your turn. I will give you the final example. 
Compare both outputs, and then select the preferred answers by saying either Output (a), TIE, or Output (b). You should not be biased towards the position of the response.

### Final Example

#### Final Instruction:
{instruction}

#### Output (a) for final example:
{output_1}

#### Output (b) for final example:
{output_2}

## Preferred Output for final example:
Now write your thought and choose the preferred output for final example. Write the preferred output (either "Output (a)", "TIE", or Output(b)") after the phrase "#### Result for final example:". Think before you speak.
